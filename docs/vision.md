The vision of this project is to explore how explicit, domain-specific rules can be transformed into a practical decision system.
Rather than aiming for completeness or linguistic perfection, the project focuses on clarity of reasoning, transparency of assumptions, and measurable outcomes.
Polish orthography is used as a concrete example of a complex, rule-driven domain where ambiguity and exceptions are common.
